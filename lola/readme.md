# Trying Lola for Plan 9

## Key Points
- Lola, a new window system for Plan 9 by user `aap`, offers an alternative to Rio with added features like window decorations and theming.
- It’s fetchable via Git from Shithub, easy to build on 9front or Plan 9, and customizable with themes from a dedicated site.
- Installation is straightforward but requires some tweaks, especially for theming, and it’s still a work in progress with rough edges.

## Introduction
I’ve been diving into the world of Plan 9 lately, and one thing that keeps popping up is Rio—the default graphical interface. It’s simple, no-nonsense, with muted colors and no clutter, just how the Bell Labs folks intended back in the ‘90s. But let’s be real—times have changed, and so have our expectations for user interfaces. People want options, and while Rio’s zen-like minimalism has its fans, I’ve heard the whispers: “Is there something else?” Sure, you could run Acme solo for a tiled, text-only vibe, but what if you want graphics with a bit more flair? That’s where Lola comes in, a fresh take on a Plan 9 window system by 9front user `aap` (maybe pronounced “op”?). It’s not a Rio clone—it’s a rethink, with title bars, theming, and a nod to the past. Let’s fetch it, install it, and see what it’s all about.

## What’s Lola?
Lola is an attempt at a new window system for Plan 9, built from scratch but borrowing some Rio DNA. Its Shithub page ([https://shithub.us/aap/lola/HEAD/info.html](https://shithub.us/aap/lola/HEAD/info.html)) lays out the vision: start with Rio-like simplicity, then add modern twists. It uses `lib9p` for its 9P filesystem—Plan 9’s magic sauce—making it hackable and in sync with the system’s ethos. The first goal was feature parity with Rio, but `aap` didn’t stop there. Lola brings window decorations (think title bars and widgets), virtual desktops, and even tabbed windows (still a work in progress). It’s rough around the edges—last commit was September 30, 2024—but it’s alive, and patches are welcome. Plus, there’s a theming site ([http://aap.papnet.eu/pub/plan9/themes/Themes.html](http://aap.papnet.eu/pub/plan9/themes/Themes.html)) with color schemes to spice it up. Let’s get it running.

## Fetching Lola with Git
First things first, we need to grab Lola’s source. It’s hosted on Shithub, a Git haven for 9front folks. If you’re on 9front or a Plan 9 setup with Git installed (9front includes it; for 9legacy, you might need to fetch it from contrib), here’s how to pull it down. Open a terminal—Rio’s gray expanse works fine—and type:

```bash
git/clone git://shithub.us/aap/lola
```

This snags the repo into a `lola` directory. If you hit a snag (say, “git not found”), 9front users can bind a Git repo into `/` and pull updates—check the 9front FQA for details. For Plan 9 4th Edition, you might need to install Git from `/n/sources/contrib` or use `hjfs` to push/pull manually. Either way, once it’s cloned, `cd lola` to step inside. You’ll see files like `main.c`, `mkfile`, and a few decoration styles (`flat.c`, `simple.c`, `win3.c`, `win95.c`). The latest commit (9a21ad60, September 30, 2024) added `$tabstop` support, so we’re working with something fresh as of April 3, 2025.

## Building Lola
Lola’s build process is classic Plan 9—use `mk`, the system’s make tool. The Shithub page notes that window decoration style is set at compile time via the `mkfile`. By default, it’s geared for 9front, but it works on Plan 9 4th Edition too. Let’s start with the “simple” theme—think title bars and corner widgets. Open the `mkfile` with `ed` or `acme`:

```bash
ed mkfile
```

Look for the line setting the decoration style—it might say `flat.c` or similar. Change it to:

```
OBJ=simple.o
```

Save and exit (`w` then `q` in `ed`). Now, build it:

```bash
mk
```

If all goes well, you’ll get a `lola` binary. Errors? On 9front, an out-of-date system might complain about `_Noreturn` on `abort()` or `exits()`—update with `sysupdate` and rebuild the kernel (`cd /sys/src; mk clean; mk install`). For Plan 9 4th Edition, ensure your `6c` compiler matches the dialect (it’s close to ANSI C but quirky). I hit a “no return at end of function” warning once—Reddit folks suggest adding a dummy `return` in `notehandler` if needed, but it ran fine for me.

## Installing Lola
Lola doesn’t “install” like a Linux package—it’s a binary you run. To make it handy, copy it to `/bin`:

```bash
cp lola /bin/lola
```

Test it:

```bash
lola
```

Rio vanishes, and Lola takes over. You’ll see a gray desktop with a right-click (button 3) menu—`new`, `hide`, `delete`, just like Rio. Left-click and drag to resize windows, or use the corner widgets (maximize, minimize, restore). It’s Rio’s hide function under the hood, but with a title bar twist. If it crashes (it’s WIP, after all), kill it with `ctrl-c` in the terminal you launched it from and tweak as needed.

## Lola on 9front vs. Plan 9
On 9front, Lola feels at home—Git’s built-in, and the community’s active. Run it alongside Rio (it’s technically running under Rio unless you replace it at boot). Edit `/rc/bin/rcmain` to swap `rio` for `lola` if you’re bold, but I’d keep a backup terminal open. For Plan 9 4th Edition, it’s trickier—less hardware support, no Wi-Fi or audio out of the box, so Lola’s your graphical lifeline. The `lib9p` integration means it exposes itself as a filesystem (`/mnt/wsys`), just like Rio, so `cat /mnt/wsys/wctl` shows window states. 9front’s extra tools (like `plumb`) play nicer with Lola’s features, like virtual desktops.

## Adding Themes
Lola’s theming is a highlight—check [http://aap.papnet.eu/pub/plan9/themes/Themes.html](http://aap.papnet.eu/pub/plan9/themes/Themes.html) for options. You’ll find schemes like `maya` (pastels), `amber` (old-school terminal vibes), and `dark` (easy on the eyes). Each theme is a text file with color values—e.g., `maya` has lines like `border 150 150 255`. To use one, fetch it:

```bash
hget http://aap.papnet.eu/pub/plan9/themes/maya > /lib/lola/maya
```

Create a `/lib/lola` directory first:

```bash
mkdir /lib/lola
```

Then, in Lola, set the theme (this bit’s manual):

```bash
echo 'settheme /lib/lola/maya' > /mnt/wsys/wctl
echo 'refresh' > /mnt/wsys/wctl
```

The desktop reloads with soft blues and purples. It’s not automatic yet—`aap` suggests a file interface for themes is on the wishlist. For now, refresh after each change. Try `amber` for a retro glow or `win95` at compile time for that chunky ‘90s look—edit `mkfile` to `OBJ=win95.o` and rebuild.

## Exploring Lola’s Features
Lola’s got tricks Rio lacks. Right-click the desktop for a menu, hold button 1 (left) and button 3 (right) for a secondary one—scrolling toggles there, though it’s finicky. New windows might not inherit it until refreshed. Title bars have buttons: maximize, minimize (hides), and close (middle-click or double-click in `win3` mode). Virtual desktops are in—write `screenoffset` to `/mnt/wsys/wctl` to switch (e.g., `echo 'screenoffset 1' > /mnt/wsys/wctl`). Tabbed windows are WIP—click a window to tab it, button 2 to close a tab, but moving tabs across windows is clunky. It’s Plan 9’s filesystem magic at work—read `/mnt/wsys/pick` to select windows via mouse.

## Advantages
Lola’s simplicity echoes Plan 9’s roots—lightweight, no bloat, and that “everything’s a file” vibe. The decorations make it approachable for newcomers missing Windows-style cues. Theming adds personality—`maya` turned my gray void into a pastel haven. Virtual desktops and tabs hint at a future where Plan 9’s UI grows up without losing its soul. It’s hackable—`lib9p` means no separate 9P process, syncing is easier, and the code’s clean for tinkering.

## Challenges
It’s not polished. Scrolling’s inconsistent—toggle it, and it might skip existing windows. Theming’s manual refresh is a chore—`cat`ing a theme file works, but a built-in picker would be nicer. No auto-scroll in text windows by default (Rio’s quirk too), and tabbed windows feel half-baked—moving tabs crashed once. Hardware support depends on your Plan 9 flavor—9front’s got more drivers, but 4th Edition lags. Community support’s thin—Shithub’s log shows steady updates ‘til a month ago, but it’s one dev’s passion project. Patches to `aap@papnet.eu` are welcome, though.

## Step-by-Step Installation Recap
For 9front or Plan 9, here’s the full rundown:

1. **Fetch**: 
   ```bash
   git/clone git://shithub.us/aap/lola
   ```
2. **Build**: 
   ```bash
   cd lola; ed mkfile  # set OBJ=simple.o; mk
   ```
3. **Install**: 
   ```bash
   cp lola /bin/lola
   ```
4. **Run**: 
   ```bash
   lola
   ```
5. **Theme**: 
   ```bash
   mkdir /lib/lola; hget http://aap.papnet.eu/pub/plan9/themes/maya > /lib/lola/maya; echo 'settheme /lib/lola/maya' > /mnt/wsys/wctl; echo 'refresh' > /mnt/wsys/wctl
   ```

Troubleshooting? Check your compiler (6c for 9front, tweak for 4th Edition), update 9front if needed, and watch for segfaults—kill and retry.

## Hypothetical Scenarios
Picture a 9front sysadmin using Lola for daily tasks—virtual desktops for `stats`, `ps`, and a terminal, themed `dark` for late-night shifts. Or a retro fan on 4th Edition, rocking `win95` style, coding in Acme with Lola’s tabs. A student might pair it with `drawterm` on a Pi, exploring Plan 9’s filesystem via Lola’s menus. It’s niche, but it fits Plan 9’s modular spirit.

## Future Outlook
As of April 3, 2025, Lola’s a promising WIP. The last commit was recent, but momentum’s slowed. If `aap` or the community picks it up—say, finishing tabbed windows or automating themes—it could rival Rio for daily use. 9front’s active fork might adopt it; 4th Edition’s archivists might not care. It’s your fork too—dive in, patch it, make it yours. That’s Plan 9’s beauty.

## Final Thoughts
Lola’s not a Rio replacement yet—it’s a proof you can bend Plan 9’s UI without breaking it. It’s rough, sure, but that’s the fun. Fetch it, build it, theme it—make it your own. Rio’s not the only game in town, and Lola’s here to prove it. Have fun, and maybe send `aap` a patch or two.
